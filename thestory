Once upon a time there was this dude who had to write a story for class. He spent hours thinking of what to write about but could never come up with anything so he passed it off to a partner for new ideas.

This is a quest story. The story is about a contemplative dancer who is married to a cyborg. It takes place in a port city in Russia. The crux of the story involves a premonition. A spatial anomoly plays a major role in the story.
